# What is Binary Exploitation

Binary exploitation is a technique used in cybersecurity to take advantage of weaknesses in software at a very basic level. 
Binary exploitation focuses on manipulating the machine's code, to perform actions it wasn't designed to do.
 
* Binary exploitation focuses on vulnerabilities in compiled programs, often called binaries. These are the machine code instructions that the computer directly executes. 
* By manipulating the code, attackers (or ethical hackers) can make the program do things the developers never intended, such as granting unauthorized access or stealing data.
