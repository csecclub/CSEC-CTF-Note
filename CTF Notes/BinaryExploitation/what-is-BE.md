# What is Binary Exploitation

Binary exploitation is a technique used in cybersecurity to take advantage of weaknesses in software at a very basic level. 
Binary exploitation focuses on manipulating the machine's code, to perform actions it wasn't designed to do.
 
* Binary exploitation focuses on vulnerabilities in compiled programs, often called binaries. These are the machine code instructions that the computer directly executes. 
* By manipulating the code, attackers (or ethical hackers) can make the program do things the developers never intended, such as granting unauthorized access or stealing data.

**Methods**: 
* There are various methods for exploiting vulnerabilities, but a common one involves **buffer overflows**. This is when a program tries to stuff too much data into a limited space in memory, spilling over and potentially corrupting critical information like the program's instructions.

This helps with...

Identify vulnerabilities: 
* Security professionals can use these techniques to find weaknesses in software before malicious actors do.

Write secure code: 
* Programmers can learn how their code might be exploited and take steps to prevent it.

However, it's important to note that binary exploitation is an advanced topic. It requires a deep understanding of computer architecture, assembly language, and how programs interact with memory. Making it one of the more difficult topics to get into.
